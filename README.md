# svr-rf-stock-price-prediction
A project I did for my research course in Binus Universiry (COMP6696001 â€“ Research Methodology in Computer Science), _**"Evaluating the Performance of Support Vector Regression and Random Forest for Stock Price Prediction in the IDX"**_. This repository contains the source code and datasets used in the research. 

The primary objective of the research was to evaluate the performance of SVR and RF in predicting stock prices within the IDX. Afterwards I compared the accuracy and effectiveness of both models in capturing future stock price movements.

The results indicate that the Random Forest model generally outperforms the Support Vector Regression model for most of the stocks, especially in cases where the data exhibits complex, non-linear patterns. The RF model's ensemble approach and ability to handle non-linear relationships give it an advantage in capturing the underlying trends in the stock prices. However, the SVR model also showed competitive performance for some stocks, highlighting its strength in handling specific types of data patterns.
